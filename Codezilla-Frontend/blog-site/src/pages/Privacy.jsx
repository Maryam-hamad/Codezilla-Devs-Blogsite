        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>
          At <strong>Codezilla Devs Blog</strong>, your privacy matters. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights as a visitor.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          We may collect information you provide voluntarily, such as your email address if you sign up for our newsletter or leave a comment. We also collect non-personal data through analytics tools, like your browser type and pages visited.
        </p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          Your data helps us improve the website, send updates, and understand what content is most helpful. We never sell your personal information to third parties.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          We may use third-party services such as Google Analytics to analyze traffic, or hosting providers to store content. These providers have their own privacy practices.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          We use cookies and similar technologies to enhance your experience, track site performance, and personalize content. You can disable cookies in your browser settings.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Sharing Information</h2>
        <p>
          We only share information if legally required, or if you give explicit consent. Your personal information is never sold or shared for advertising purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We take reasonable measures to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
          You can unsubscribe from newsletters, delete comments, or request deletion of your personal data by contacting us.

        <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Continued use of the site constitutes acceptance of any changes. Please check this page periodically for updates.
